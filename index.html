          C++ is a fun language to learn. It has many applications including
          creating operating systems and games. This is just a basic overview of
          some fundamental concepts in c++ programming and I hope you will enjoy
          it!

        <p>
          Variables are like a bucket that store a certain type of data. There
          are various types of data than you can store in C++, such as numbers,
          texts and charcters. To create a variable, you have to first declare
          the type of data and give it a name. You can also assign a value to
          variable accorrding to the type of data declared.
        </p>
        <p>These are the common variabes found in C++:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>string: stores a series of charcters that form text</li>
          <li>int: stores an integer that has no decimals</li>
          <li>double: stores a number with decimals</li>
          <li>boolean: stores the value of either"true" or "false"</li>
          <li>char: stores a single character such as an alphabet</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are a few examples of declaring variables in C++</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
    string name="joe";

    int age=35;

    bool single=true;
          </code>
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section id="Input-and-Output" class="main-section">
        <header>Input and Output</header>
        <p>
          Output is something that will appear on a window once you build and
          run a program that you've written. To do that you have to type in a
          keyword called "cout" followed by the things that you wish to output.
          Input is something the user enters(a data) that will be stored inside
          a place in the program(such as a variable). To get an input from the
          user, a keyword "cin" is used followed by the variable where you want
          to store the data. Also, you might want to output a prompt to tell
          what the users what kind of information they should enter.
        </p>
        <p>Here are examples of cin and cout:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
    string name; //declare a variable to store a name

    getline(cin, name); //request name from user
    
    cout&lt;&lt;"Your name is "&lt;&lt;name;
          </code>
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section id="If-Statements" class="main-section">
        <header>If Statements</header>
        <p>
          If statements are logical operators that execute a command if the
          requirements are met. If the requirements are not fulfilled, the
          commands inside the if statement will not be carried out. To set an if
          statement the if(){} is used. The () should contain the requirements
          while the {} should contain the commands.
        </p>
        <p>Here's how you set an if statement:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
    int score=87;

    if(score>=80){
      cout&lt;&lt;"You got an A!";
    }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section id="Loops" class="main-section">
        <header>Loops</header>
        <p>
          There are many types of loops and the one we will be talking about is
          called the while loop. A while loop is basically a programming
          structure that will execute a block of code repeatedly if certain
          conditions are fulfilled(just like if statements). To set up a while
          loop, you will need to type out while(){} where () contains the
          condition and {} the code you want the loop to execute. Do make sure
          that the conditions in the () will not always be true so that you
          don't end up with an infinite loop.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here is an example of a while loop. Take note that at the end of the
          code the variable is increased so that the condition will eventually
          false and you will break out of the loop.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
    int age=1;

    while(age&lt;18){
      cout&lt;&lt;"You are not an adult yet.";
      age=age+1; //age is increased by one after each loop
    }
          </code>
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Arrays">
        <header>Arrays</header>
        <p>
          Just like variables arrays are able to store data. However, instead of
          being limited to only storing one data, arrays can store multiple
          data. To declare an array you have to declare the type of data(such as
          int) and give it a name. Then, put a [] that contains the number of
          elements in the array.
        </p>
        <p>Here is how you set up an array and access its elements:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
    int randomNumbers[3]={2,5,9}; //array with three numbers is created
    
    cout&lt;&lt;randomNumbers[0]; //2 will be printed out
    cout&lt;&lt;randomNumbers[1]; //5 will be printed out
    cout&lt;&lt;randomNumbers[2]; //9 will be printed out
          </code>
        </pre>
